            Bellossom is a primarily green flowering plant Pokémon with circular blue eyes and red markings on its cheeks. It has two bright red Rafflesia-like flowers on its head and green and yellow leaves around its waist that resemble a skirt, all adding to the appearance of a hula dancer. Bellossom's petals are said to be more beautiful the worse the aroma of the Gloom it evolved from. When it rubs the petals on its head together, it creates a pleasing sound. Bellossom does not possess feet; in the Pokémon the Series episode Flower Power, its center-most leaves bent as it was getting ready to spring, suggesting that it uses its leaves as substitutes for feet or legs. However, the Pokédex does classify it as a biped.

            It evolves from Gloom when exposed to a Sun Stone. It is one of Oddish's final forms, the other being Vileplume.

            Due to the effects of the Sun Stone, it is now active during the daytime. It likes to dance in pools of sunlight.
